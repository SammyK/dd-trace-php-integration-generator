# Datadog PHP Tracer Integration Generator

...because short names for things are not cool.

## Usage

To generate the integration boilerplate for `ClassName`, simply run:

```bash
$ ./run generate:integration ClassName
```

This will generate a file called `ClassNameIntegration.php` that you can use to complete the integration by adjusting the existing boilerplate or removing unimportant methods.

## TODO LIST

- [ ] Ask questions from TTY for namespace, default tags, etc.
